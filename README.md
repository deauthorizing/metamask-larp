# metamask-larp

A dogshit source code of sudodis's Metamask clone - leaked by wish and epik, originally from a deal between me and sudodis.

# ⚠️ Bugs

THIS SCRIPT IS NOT PERFECT AND WE WILL NOT FIX IT, DO NOT ASK US FOR SUPPORT.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps money on a Metamask clone
- Other than that, nothing else works LOL

## 🛠 Install

1. Download the index.html and the wallet.html from our GitHub repo, you may check the source code if you are scared that it might be ratted.
2. Then put them in a folder called "dogshit metamask ahaha" for it to work, then run index.html
3. Your browser should open a shitty Metamask clone with 10% of it being functional, if you want then you may pack it in an extension and use it.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **visual-only LARP** this shit is ass anyways
Also if you resell this you are a broke no name
